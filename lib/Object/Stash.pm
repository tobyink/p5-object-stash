=head1 NAME

Object::Stash - provides a Catalyst-like "stash" method for your class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 {
   package MyClass;
   use Object::New;
   use Object::Stash 'data';
 }
 
 use feature 'say';
 use Data::Printer qw(p);
 my $obj = MyClass->new;
 p $obj->data;                     # an empty hashref
 $obj->data(foo => 1, bar => 2);   # sets values in the 'data' stash
 $obj->data({foo => 1, bar => 2}); # same
 p $obj->data;                     # hashref with keys 'foo', 'bar'
 say $obj->data->{foo};            # says '1'
 
 # Retrieve multiple values
 my @values = $obj->data(['foo', 'bar']);
 say $values[0];                   # says '1'
 say $values[1];                   # says '2'
 
 # Or in scalar context
 my $values = $obj->data(['foo', 'bar']);
 say $values->[0];                 # says '1'
 say $values->[1];                 # says '2'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<Catalyst> context object has a method called stash, that provides a
hashref for storing arbitrary data associated with the object. This is
arguably a little hackish - the proper solution might be to create a slot
for each piece of information you wish to store, with appropriate accessor
methods. But often hackish will do.

(And there are non-hackish ways of using Object::Stash. Take a look at
L<Web::Magic> which uses a private stash - named with a leading underscore -
and provides public methods for accessing various things stored inside it.)

Object::Stash sets up one or more stash methods for your class. How these
methods are named depends on how Object::Stash is imported. Object::Stash
is a role, like L<Object::New> or L<Object::ID>. This means you import it,
but don't inherit from it.

=head2 Default method name

 package MyClass;
 use Object::Stash;

Creates a single method for MyClass objects. The method is called "stash".

=head2 Custom method name

 package MyClass;
 use Object::Stash 'data';

Creates a single method for MyClass objects. The method is called "data".

=head2 Multiple methods

 package MyClass;
 use Object::Stash qw/important trivial/;

Creates two stashes for MyClass objects, called "important" and "trivial".
Adding data to one stash will not affect the other stash. You could
alternatively write:

 package MyClass;
 use Object::Stash 'important'
 use Object::Stash 'trivial';

=head2 Adding stashes to other classes

 package MyClass;
 use Object::Stash -package => 'YourClass', 'my_stash';

Creates a stash called "my_stash" for YourClass objects.

=head2 Utility Functions

=over

=item C<< Object::Stash->is_stash( $coderef ) >>

Returns true if the method is a stash. For example:

  my $method = MyClass->can('trivial');
  if (Object::Stash->is_stash($method))
  {
    $method->(foo => 1, bar => 2);
  }

Can also be called as C<< Object::Stash::is_stash($coderef) >>.

=back

=head2 Stash Storage

Stashes are stored "inside-out", meaning that they will work not only with
objects which are blessed hashrefs, but also with any other type of object
internals. Dumping your object with L<Data::Dumper> or similar will not
display the contents of the stashes. (A future release of this module may
introduce other storage options, but the current inside-out storage is
likely to remain the default.)

Thanks to L<Hash::FieldHash>, an object's stashes I<should> get automatically
garbage collected once the object itself is destroyed, unless you've
maintained your own references to the stashes.

=head2 Stash Objects

While stashes are usually hashrefs, there is also an option to make stashes
themselves blessed objects. It's best to illustrate this with an example

 {
   package MyClass;
   use Object::New;
   use Object::Stash 'data', -type => 'object';
 }
 
 # All this stuff from SYNOPSIS still works...
 use feature 'say';
 use Data::Printer qw(p);
 my $obj = MyClass->new;
 p $obj->data;                     # an empty hashref
 $obj->data(foo => 1, bar => 2);   # sets values in the 'data' stash
 $obj->data({foo => 1, bar => 2}); # same
 say $obj->data->{foo};            # says '1'
 
 my @values = $obj->data(['foo', 'bar']);
 say $values[0];                   # says '1'
 say $values[1];                   # says '2'
 
 my $values = $obj->data(['foo', 'bar']);
 say $values->[0];                 # says '1'
 say $values->[1];                 # says '2'
 
 # But now you can retrieve data using accessor methods...
 say $obj->data->foo;              # says '1'
 
 # The accessors work as not just getters, but setters...
 $obj->data->foo(99);
 
 # The accessors can be treated as lvalues...
 $obj->data->foo = 100;
 $obj->data->foo++;
 
 # Cool, huh?
 say $obj->data->{foo};            # says '101'
 
 # In case you were wondering...
 say ref $obj->data;               # says 'Object::Stash::data'
